REST,adopt,languages and frameworks,FALSE,"Enables microservices, cloud compatibility, modern, user-friendly, http-client, light"
sprint-boot-2,adopt,languages and frameworks,TRUE,"Solves fat-jar size issues experienced with spring-boot-1"
JSON,adopt,languages and frameworks,FALSE,"Standard for REST"
slf4j,adopt,languages and frameworks,FALSE,""
health-check API,adopt,languages and frameworks,FALSE,"Doubts on its usage, perf issues encountered, no visual tools"
metrics,adopt,languages and frameworks,FALSE,"To check further"
sprint-boot-1,hold,languages and frameworks,TRUE,"Presents fat-jar size issues. Replaced with spring-boot-2"
JAXB,hold,languages and frameworks,TRUE,"Lost to json for REST compatibility and limiting technical diversity. Some remnants still there. To be reviewed."
Embedded Tomcat,adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"Comes with spring-boot. More details?"
maven archetype plugin,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Generated agent-based services from scratch"
java-rest-runtime-maven-plugin,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Packages REST service scripts during build. It's a standalone plugin, making it easier to use, maintain, evolve. Allows verification of endpoints (alignment of endpoints between the code and yaml files). Allows auto-generation of authorization.xml from annotations to handle authorizations"
maven-production-plugin,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Packages REST service script in MX primary/secondary"
junit,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Standard for Java test-in-dev"
Middleware test framework (micro-framework),adopt,tools,FALSE,"Starts services locally, can test interactions between services. Supports RMI and JSF services. Load-balancer is bypassed (windows issues for http). Can bypass authn/authz token. Difficult to use. Lacking expertise and issues on it handled with low priority."
rest-runtime-test-framework,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Wrapper of default spring integration tests. Launches only one JSF service for unitary tests"
Liquibase,adopt,tools,FALSE,"create data-model and manages its upgrades"
logger-management,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Script that allows changing the log level dynamically, packaged within the MX primary"
initialize-resources,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Script that initializes resources for services that require messaging and authorization. Force messaging/authz/authn to reload resources."
MVR,trial,tools,FALSE,"Mini mx setup (primary/secondary) using docker compose. Takes 10/15min to launch all services. Allows simulation of  distribution of services on several containers as if they are on different machines (or on one single machine). Source within the MX version. Duplication of parent pom. Internal to Amber. Used by counterpart demo and Chaos/stress tests. USes MsSQL/HSQL. (https://coconut/xref/v3.1.build/component/mvr/). Liquibase used to load a dump of data in the database. Post-install step creates default data used for authn/authz (Created by the old blue team, was sponsored at some point but current sponsorship unclear).
maven-remote-resources-plugin,assess,tools,FALSE,"Unclear what it's used for"
maven-resources-plugin,assess,tools,FALSE,"unclear what it's used for"
rest-runtime-assembly-addon,hold,tools,FALSE,"Extension/addon of maven-assembly plugin. Assembles JSF resources. Does not function by itself (co-operation with 4 different plugins). Does not allow flexibility to add steps. All add-on plugins are being deprecated and replaced by a standalone plugin"
CI pipeline,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"CJE-based. Builds, executes tests and static code analysis and test coverage via Sonar. Launches unit, integration - MTF, and TPK2673 automatically, and allows launching of, counterpart demo manually."
Stress/chaos tests,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"Currently being executed. Allows reproducing resilience scenarios in a controlled environment. Not idustrialized yet (can we consider them adopted?)"
API-first for REST apis,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"Adopted for functional services. API is defined, reviewed and approved before implementation begins."
